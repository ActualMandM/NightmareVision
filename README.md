## How to compile NV Engine

### Download the prerequisites... (skip this if you already have compiled any fnf project, or any flixel project basically lol)

[Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

[VS Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

within the VS Community Installer, download `Desktop development with c++`

### Download the projects required libraries...

In a cmd within the project directory, in order run...

> haxelib install hxpkg --global

> haxelib run hxpkg setup --global

> hxpkg install

### Quick Note
- This engine ENFORCES the use of local libraries with hxpkg/hmm to prevent issues in relation to `hxvlc`
- The recommend library versions are within the .hxpkg.


After that is complete, run `lime test windows` and you should be compiling
